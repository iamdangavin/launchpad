Launchpad
=========

Launchpad is an extremely opinionated WordPress theme for developers.  This theme is still "in beta," but is probably usable if you test settings extensively before launch.  The theme is meant to be hacked on directly, but you should be able to child-theme it to some degree.  

I'm not sure how compatible this theme is WPMU.

A few sites have been developed on top of Launchpad, and more are in the works.  Feedback from this process is being integrated back into Launchpad as issues arise.

[Codex](_codex/index.md)
========================

For a detailed walk through, check out the [Codex](_codex/index.md).

For the long feature list that was formerly here, see the [Codex Features List](_codex/features.md).

To Do For 1.5
=============

* Database and Asset Migration Refactor
* Add section in the codex for tools / utilities

To Do For 1.6
=============

* Take another stab at MU Support
* HTML5-based Caption Shortcode Override
* UI for creating Metaboxes and Flexible Content
* Site Options
  * Multiple options pages?
  * Tabbed option pages?
  * Integrate some options into Appearance > Customize?
  * How can this be done better?
* Toggles on Meta / Flex Fields
  * Is the current toggle system for meta/flex fields sufficient?
  * Is the idea of a "watch element" a good idea? e.g. watch post_parent select box.
* Flexible content modules and field types.
  * What other modules should be built-in?
  * Other Field Types?

Future Wants
============

* Figure out if anything needs to be put in different projects for better sharing.
* Something about widgets.
* Updates through WP Admin.
* Security: some way to check MD5 of WP Core files to make sure they weren't modified.

Would Like But Not Sure If Realistic
====================================

* Research OCR for better alt tag creation.
	* This was not helpful. Still very alpha. http://phpocr.sourceforge.net
	* Maybe this can help? http://antimatter15.com/ocrad.js/demo.html
