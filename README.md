Launchpad
=========

A WordPress theme for developers.  This theme is still in beta, but is probably usable if you test settings extensively before launch.  The theme is meant to be hacked on directly.  I use CodkeKit 2 to compile SASS and handle JavaScript includes and minification.  Child-theme support is on the list for possible features, but it is probably a long way off.

Features
========

This theme has been in the works for over a year.  After working with a team that was using the [Roots WordPress theme](http://roots.io), I adopted a few conventions from there (e.g. root-relative URLs, built-in custom rewrites, and HTML5 Boilerplate integration) and combined them with some of my previous developer-friendly theme ideas.  I also had some thoughts on how to make a modern website work (e.g. built-in content caching, offline support with intelligent applicationCache reloading, and AJAX page loading), so I added those to it.

I'll be building out current feature list as I get the time.
