Launchpad SASS
==============

Launchpad ships with some helpful SASS features to help get you started quicker and help you organize your files.  Launchpad's SASS attempts to push OOCSS, includes features to help with vertical rhythm, and tries to help you along the way with print stylesheets and editor stylesheets.

## Organization

Launhpad has five "top-level" SASS files:

1. screen.scss
2. print.scss
3. editor-style.scss
4. admin-style.scss
5. unsupported.scss

### screen.scss

The screen style sheet includes the bulk of the SASS partials.  These are the partials and their functions:

<dl>
	<dt>variables</dt>
	<dd></dd>
	<dt>mixins</dt>
	<dd></dd>
	<dt>grid</dt>
	<dd></dd>
	<dt>objects</dt>
	<dd></dd>
	<dt>reset</dt>
