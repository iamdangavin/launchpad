Launchpad Admin Modifications
=============================

Launchpad makes several modifications to the WordPress admin.  Most of them have been covered in previous sections:

* Launchpad Settings: [Settings Section](settings.md)
* Custom Metaboxes, Flexible Content, and Help: [Post Types Section](post-types.md)
* Adding Fields to Launchpad Settings, Relocating Launchpad Settings, etc: [Launchpad Hooks Section](hooks.md)
* Where to add additional admin styles if you are brave: [SASS Section](sass.md)

With that knowledge, you are armed with everything you need to know.  I think it's apt to point out here, again, that you can add help to any post type, metabox, flexible content, or field that is built through Launchpad's post types to add help menus for your user.

I thought I had more to say here, but I can't remember what I thought was so important.  So, maybe start reading about [Launchpad's SEO](seo.md).
