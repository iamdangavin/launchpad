Launchpad Caveats and Browser Support
=====================================

Launchpad was created for a specific development mindset and workflow.  If you don't agree with this, it is likely that you will struggle making Launchpad work for you.  So, it's important to understand what you're getting into.

Launchpad's front end code currently supports the latest version of the following browsers:

* Safari
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer

Due to the slow update cycle of Internet Explorer, the Launchpad front end currently supports the following legacy versions of Internet Explorer:

* Internet Explorer 10
* Internet Explorer 9
* Internet Explorer 8

**Internet Explorer 8 support will be dropped by the end of 2014!!!***

Unsupported versions of Internet Explorer recieve [Andrew Clarke's Universal Stylesheet](https://code.google.com/p/universal-ie6-css/).
