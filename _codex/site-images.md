Launchpad Site Images
=====================

Launchpad includes templates to generate the following device images:

1. Favicon (1x and 2x)
2. Apple iOS Icons for all Apple iOS devices
3. Apple Loading Screen
4. Theme Screen Shots
5. Logo

To generate favicons and iOS icons, navigate to images/icons/ and replace each of the apple-touch-icon-* and favicon* image with the appropriately sized icons.

The Apple Loading Screen images are also available to replace manually, but you may also make use of the Photoshop template.  The template provides an area to generate a generic graphic of appropriate size to cover all Apple devices.  Each device is represented with a black box.  Simply create your large loading graphic and create images at each size represented by the black box, then replace the appropriate images with your updated image.

The theme screen shot can be found at screenshot.png.  There is a PSD template available should you need it, or you can create your own at the correct size to replace screenshot.png.

The logo file is available in images/logo.png.

Once you have generated all the site images, you can start to [configuring your post types](post-types.md).
